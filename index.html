        <p><h1>THE BOYS</h1></p>
        <div>
            <p>The Boys is an American satirical superhero television series
                developed by Eric Kripke for Amazon Prime Video. Based on the
                comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson,
                it follows the eponymous team of vigilantes as they combat
                superpowered individuals who abuse their powers. The series
                features an ensemble cast that includes Karl Urban, Jack Quaid,
                Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Dominique McElligott, Jessie T.
                Usher, Chace Crawford, Laz Alonso, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara,
                and Nathan Mitchell.
                Originally intended to be a feature-length film, the comic book series adaptation began its development in 2008 with Adam McKay set to direct the film. Due to creative differences between the crew and the studios that picked up the film, the project was left in development hell. The development for the project was revived in 2016 by Cinemax, which announced that it would be reworked as a television series. Kripke was recruited to be the showrunner of the series, while Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg would be the executive producers. Amazon Studios obtained the rights for the series in November 2017, with production starting in May 2018 in Toronto.
                The Boys premiered its first season of eight episodes on July 26, 2019. A second season premiered on September 4, 2020, with the third season following on June 3, 2022. Also in June 2022, the series was renewed for a fourth season, which is scheduled to be released in 2024. As part of a shared universe, a spin-off web series, Seven on 7, premiered in July 2021, an animated anthology series, Diabolical, premiered in March 2022, and a second live-action television series, Gen V, premiered in September 2023. Since its release, the series has received critical acclaim and praise for its writing, storyline, humor, effects, and performances of the cast, particularly Urban and Starr's portrayal of Billy Butcher and Homelander, respectively. The series was nominated for six Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2021.

        <h2><br>Premise</h2>
        <p><b>The Boys</b> is set in a universe where superpowered individuals
            (colloquially known as "supes") are recognized as heroes by the
            general public and work for a powerful corporation known as Vought
            International that markets and monetizes them. Outside their heroic
            personas, most supes are corrupt and self-serving. The series
            primarily focuses on two groups: the Boys, a team of vigilantes
            looking to bring down Vought and its corrupt superheroes, and the
            Seven, Vought's premier superhero team overseen by executive Madelyn
            Stillwell.</p>
