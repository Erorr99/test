      <h2>PROFILE</h2></main>
    <div>
      Choso (脹ちょう相そう Chōsō?) is a supporting character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He and his two brothers, Kechizu and Eso are incarnated Cursed Womb: Death Paintings No. 1-3. Choso initially sided with Kenjaku's alliance with Mahito until he discovered one of the curse user's past identities was the cruel father of the Death Painting Wombs, Noritoshi Kamo. He also found out that Yuji Itadori is another relative of Kenjaku's and has aligned himself with his new "younger brother".

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <div>As a Death Painting Womb, Choso is a half-human, half-cursed spirit who has a flesh and blood body that is fully visible even to non-sorcerers. His appearance is predominantly that of a human man with long black stringy hair tied into two high ponytails that jut upward and outward. Choso has small dark purple eyes with slightly thin eyebrows and a blood mark that extends from both sides of his face across the bridge of his nose. He can make this mark bleed at will in order to produce ammunition for his cursed technique, and the mark changes shape if he uses Flowing Red Scale.</div>
